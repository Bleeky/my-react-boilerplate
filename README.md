# react-boilerplate

Depending on needs and feelings, use either `redux-thunk` on the `dev` branch, or `redux-observable` on the `redux-rxjs` branch.

Using `rxjs-ajax-wrapper`, check it out [here]()

Checkout `redux-thunk` [here](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)

Checkout `redux-observable` [here](https://redux-observable.js.org/)

## How to setup

Quite simple, nothing special here :

`git clone` on the branch corresponding to the architecture you wish to start your project with.

`npm install`

`npm start`

You're ready to go !
